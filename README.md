## MOTIVATION

TTT2 was the next logical step after TTT was such a massive success.
It is a spiritual successor to this classic gamemode by Bad King Urgrain.
Aiming to introduce new features, fix old bugs and modernize the user interface.

## ADDONS

We know that TTT lives from its huge community and all its great addons.
Because of this, **compatibility** is one of the highest priorities.
Almost every item that works with TTT also works with TTT2.
HUD and role related addons are the exceptions.

Additionally we have introduced a compatibility checker.
On server start it prints incompatible or outdated addons to the server console.
More on this in our documentation [here](https://docs.ttt2.neoxult.de/troubleshooting/#addon-checker).

TTT2 also features some additions which TTT needed addons for:

* overhauled equipment menu
* drowning indicator
* sprinting and stamina

[![TTT2 Heroes](https://i.imgur.com/WVuPmxP.png)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1737047642)

## SETUP

The setup is fairly easy. Just subscribe to TTT2 and the addons you want to use.

Removal of the 'vanilla' TTT files is **not** needed and actively harmful as those
files are still needed for TTT2.

## THE HISTORY OF TTT2

The idea of TTT2 was born in early 2018 by Alf21.
He was annoyed of all these different role mods
(such as [TTT Totem](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=828347015)
and [Town Of Terror](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1092556189))
that wouldnâ€™t work together.
So he created a new role system and called it TTT2.

Mineotopia was the first one to join his team.
He is by himself a very active player and server admin and liked the concept.
There was only one big problem: The icons were the definition of ugly.
He offered to help with graphics and over time he became an active member of TTT2.

The next big step was a project with two german youtubers, Dhalucard and PietSmiet.
We created an exclusive addon for TTT2, called TTT Heroes.
At this point, Saibotk joined the team and the development rate increased.
The idea of a completely revamped user interface was born!
