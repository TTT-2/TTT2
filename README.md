# TTT2 [Trouble in Terrorist Town 2 (Advanced Update)] // OPEN BETA
Find [TTT2 on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1357204556)

THIS ADDON IS ONLY FOR TTT, NO OTHER GAMEMODES ARE SUPPORTED!

If you want to request new features or found a bug, file a report here: https://github.com/Alf21/TTT2/issues/new

I created this addon to improve compatibility with other addons and erase those different "custom roles addons" like "TTT Totem" or "TOT - Town of Terrorists" that don't work together at all.
To play in harmony, this addon is like a library for custom roles.

This addon is NOT COMPATIBLE with TTTTotem, Town of Terror or any other addon that overrides the original TTT files (like better equipment menues or something like that). But it's made to create a solution to get an option of making roles compatible and all the other things, when using this addon as a library ;)

It is necessary to install this addon for every TTT2 custom role to work.
If you want to play some of my roles, look at this collection: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1357745995

This addon is based on sourcecode of the "TOT Addon" by KingNJenssons and of the originally TTT gamemode (everything was extremely edited by me).

If you want to add new items to the shop of a new role, you need to run the command `shopeditor` in the developer console. Chose the role and click an equipment icon. Additionally it is possible to connect shops with each other.
