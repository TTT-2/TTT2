# TTT2 Releases

## Overview

TTT2 versioning is based on semantic-versioning.
Prefixing versions with a `v` to indicate it is a version number and appending a `b` to indicate its beta status.

The latest release will be published to the Steam Workshop in form of an [addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1357204556).
The latest development will be accessible on this repository's master branch.

## Release steps

The following steps will document our release process to prevent mistakes and convey possible changes to our release process more easily.

**Note:** This is meant as a guideline to achieve the goals mentioned above. Steps may be more vague or more specific than they need to be.

1. Prepare necessary files.

    1. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.

        - Insert a level 2 heading right below `## Unreleased`
        - use the following format:

    1. Update `gamemodes/terrortown/gamemode/client/cl_changes.lua`.

        - Use the `AddChange()` function and supply it with the following three arguments:

            - An html formatted list of changes since the last release.
            - `os.time()` supplied with the current date e.g. `os.time({year = YYYY, month = MM, day = DD})`.
