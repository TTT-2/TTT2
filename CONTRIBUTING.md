First of all, thanks for your interest in this project. 

I'm happy to see new contributors improving this project and fullfilling all wishes of the TTT playerbase.
Just submit your changes as a pull request or open a new issue to request features or report bugs.

Please try to keep your code clean. If possible, use Atom in combination with the atom-beautifier package. After that, modify the Lua Beautifier to make it compatible with Glua. Just replace the named file in the Gist description with the new one: https://gist.github.com/Alf21/e86601521f67fcbb88ddc34bfa778727
