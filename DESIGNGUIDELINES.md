# Design Guidelines of TTT2

The design style of TTT2 builds on top of the TTT design and therefore inherits some of the original designguidelines.

## Weapons and Perks

The style of the weapon and perk design is unchanged and [a template can be found here](http://ttt.badking.net/custom-weapon-guide). Additionally there are some information found in our [icon repository](https://github.com/TimGoll/ttt_addon_graphics/tree/master/reworked_shop/). Keep in mind that weapons should always use a blue background and perks a red background. This is done to prevent confusion while buying items in the shop.

After saving the finished icon as a png (64x64px), it has to be converted into a vtf file. The tool [vtf-edit](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VTFEdit) helps with the conversion. There are some details about the parameters on the website with the icon template.

## Itemdisplay Sidebar Perk Icons

The icons are always white on a transparent background, no other colors or backgrounds are allowed. Additionally the icons have a padding of x pixels and are saved as a png with a resolution of 64x64px.

## Role Icons

Different to the shop icons the role icons do need mipmapping to allow for clean rescaling (TODO more mipmapping filter information). Since the icons can be rendered quite large, they should be saved in a resolution of 512x512px. They are always white on transparent background without a shadow and a padding of x pixels.
