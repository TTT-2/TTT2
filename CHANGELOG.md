This means other roles can use this without special role syncing; additionally roles with that flag will be handled like a detective if killed by an 'evil' role, meaning that they will receive a credit bonus
  - `isPolicingRole`: This rolevar adds all "detective-like" features to the detective, for example the ability to be called to a corpse etc.

  **WARNING:** This means that every traitor now starts with 0 credits until the convar reset button is pressed (on existing servers)
- removed the `alone_bonus` convar because it only complicated the credits system further without adding much benefit
