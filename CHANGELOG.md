- Fixed inconsistency between `.disabledTeamChatRecv` and `.disabledTeamChatRec`

### Changed

- All public policing roles now appear as detectives in the chat
- Change blocking revival mode from `true`/`false` to
  - `REVIVAL_BLOCK_NONE`: don't block the winning condition during the revival process [default, previously `nil`/`false`]
  - `REVIVAL_BLOCK_COUNT_AS_ALIVE`: only block the winning condition, if the player being alive would change the outcome [previously `true`]

### Fixed

- Added in game spawn editor system that can be found in F1->Administration
- Moved all TTT weapons to this repository (with cleaned up code)
- Added in four new libraries
  - map: A library which handles map specific data
  - entspawn: A library that handles the spawning and spawns of all entity types
  - entspawnscript: A library that handles the new TTT2 entity spawn script to customize spawns
  - plyspawn: A library that builds on top of entspawn to handle the more complex player spawn (originally named spawn, see `Breaking changes`)
- Added a new submenu to the administration settings regarding basic role setup
- Added a new menu to the F1 menu to set up and configure all installed menus
- Added two new hooks to modify the contents of the newly added menu
  - `ROLE:AddToSettingsMenu(parent)`
  - `ROLE:AddToSettingsMenuCreditsForm(parent)`
- Added a new in-game player model selector
  - Added new convars that can change the way playermodels are selected (these can be found in the gamemode menu)

  - Added possibility to enable/disable detective hats for individual player models

- Added automatic default values for serverConVars
- Added two new role variables:
  - `isPublicRole`: This makes the role behave like a detective in such a way, that the role is public known and shown in the scoreboard. This means other roles can use this without special role syncing; additionally roles with that flag will be handled like a detective if killed by an 'evil' role, meaning that they will receive a credit bonus
  - `isPolicingRole`: This rolevar adds all "detective-like" features to the detective, for example the ability to be called to a corpse etc.
- Added two new role conVar variables:
  - `creditsAwardDeadEnable`: To award this role if a certain percentage of players from the enemy teams died
  - `creditsAwardKillEnable`: To award this role if they killed a high value public role

### Changed

- Changed the way credits on kills are distributed in a way that non-default roles can easily use this as well

### Breaking Changes

- Removed the (unused?) ConVar `ttt2_custom_models`
- Removed the function `GetRandomPlayerModel()`, use `playermodels.GetRandomPlayerModel()` instead
- Renamed the `spawn` module to `plyspawn`
- Hook `PlayerSelectSpawn` doesnt return a spawnEntity anymore
- SpawnWillingPlayers is deleted and not available anymore
- renamed the `ttt_credits_starting` to `ttt_traitor_credits_starting` to be more in-line with all other roles
  **WARNING:** This means that every traitor now starts with 0 credits until the convar reset button is pressed (on existing servers)
- removed the `alone_bonus` convar because it only complicated the credits system further without adding much benefit
